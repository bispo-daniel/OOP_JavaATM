# JavaATM
ATM created with Java and Swing.

Object-oriented programming.

## Functions:
Login, Create account, list accounts, statistics;

Statement, deposit, withdraw, transfer, update account, delete account and exit;

## About
This project was created as a request from my university teacher.

It was asked to be developed focusing on OOP and the following functions: Create account, list accounts, statistics and statement. 

As the project took it's final form supplying all the needed functionalities, I have decided to implement a few more.

## Challenges 
At first, because Java is statically typed I have faced a lot of errors because of data types.

I have also faced a lot of "NullPointerException". Looping a not whole fullfilled array without exiting with "Break" so I had to use try...catch blocks to deal with it.

Later on I have updated the array to an arraylist, simple loops to for-each and removed some deprecated try...catch blocks.

## Learning 
This was my first project with java, so I have learned a lot with it and it surely ignited my interest for the language.

Objects, arrays, arraylist, for, for-each, try...catch, data types and etc.
